Program A and B

A: 2 instructions, CPI 100 cycles/instruction <--- much greater CPI
B: 1000 instructions, CPI 1 cycle/instruction

To run Sequence A, will take 200 cycles. 
To run Sequence B, will take 1000 cycles.

Even though Sequence A has a larger CPI (100 cycles per 1 instruction), Sequence B can do 1000 instruction in 1 cycle,
Sequence B has more instructions, therefore it will take much longer.

CPI does not tell you which sequence is faster.
