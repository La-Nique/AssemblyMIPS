### Overview

A collection of various cpp programs I've written with extensive notes and alternative approaches. Foundational code reviewing and experimentation.

#### Synopsis of each file:

| Name of File | Description | Specialities |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| smallerNumber | compares two and three numbers with one another and outputs which is the smaller number. | if else and function stacking |
| leapYear| calculates the year the user entered and displays whether the year will be a common or leap year | boolean func |
| daysOfTheMonth | calculates the number of days that are in a certain month and year of user's input, utilizes previous leapYear function | switch case and boolean func  |
| fizzBuzz | 'FizzBuzz' challenge on Hackerrank | iterations |



<!-- Assignment One -

There is a value in the register $s0. Write a piece of MIPS code that puts in $s7 that value multiplied by 31. There are the following conditions:

    You can use only add, addi, sub instructions.
    Your code should have not more than 10 instructions.

Breaking any of these conditions leads to 0 points 

Hint: If you have a number X and you add it to itself, you receive X+X=2X. So, adding the number to itself is the same as multiplying it by 2.
