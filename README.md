# Assembly Language (MIPS)

###### Computer Architecture II
###### all files written by Lanique Peterson

### Overview

A collection of various MIPS instructions and programs I've written with extensive notes. Foundational code reviewing and experimentation.

#### Synopsis of each file:

| Name of File | Description | Specialities |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| mulitpleof31 | destination register copies value stored within another register, then is multiplied by thirty-one. | restricted to add, addi, and sub functions |
| mulitpleof24 | num = num * 24 ; the value of num is already in t4 register ; after all the computations are finished, a new value of num should also be in $t4 | restricted to add, addi, and sub functions |
| increment | A++; -- convert C++ code into MIPS | use memory address stored in a register ; lw & sw |
